This folder contains (truncated) data and code used to generate figures and tables in "Gender Gaps in Academies".

1. Data contains compiled data that we use to generate the tables and figures. Citations variables are removed from all the data files.
2. Code contains stata codes used to generate figures and tables using the compiled data. Please change the corresponding directory to this folder whenever marked with "..." in the stata code. The citation variables have been removed, and relevant commands need to be removed for the code to function properly.
